## 💰 Pricing & Commission

### How to Add Markup:

You can add commission/markup in the controller:

```javascript
// In confirmFlightPrice or createFlightOrder
const basePrice = parseFloat(flightOffer.price.grandTotal);
const markupPercentage = 5; // 5% markup
const markupAmount = basePrice * (markupPercentage / 100);
const finalPrice = basePrice + markupAmount;

// Return finalPrice to customer
// Store both basePrice (cost) and finalPrice (revenue) in database
```

**Recommended:**
- **B2C Markup:** 3-7% on base fare
- **B2B Markup:** 1-3% (corporate clients)
- **Service Fee:** Fixed amount (e.g., $20 per booking)
