# 🔧 Booking Issues - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issues Resolved:**

### **1. "Offer already booked" Error**

**Problem:**
- Duffel offers are **single-use** only
- Once you book an offer, it can't be reused
- Offer expires after 20 minutes

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Duplicate detection added
- ✅ Returns existing booking if offer already used
- ✅ Prevents multiple bookings of same offer

**What to do:**
```
Always search fresh before each booking!
Don't reuse old offers!
```

---

### **2. Timeout with Duplicate Bookings**

**Problem:**
- Booking API takes 20-30 seconds sometimes
- Frontend/Postman times out
- But booking was created on Duffel
- Creates duplicate entries

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ 30-second timeout added
- ✅ Returns timeout message
- ✅ Tells user to check bookings
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevents re-booking

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Booking**
```
1. Search flights → Get offer (off_ABC123)
2. Book offer → Success! (20 seconds)
3. Response: booking + PNR
```

### **Scenario 2: Try to Book Same Offer Twice**
```
1. Book offer (off_ABC123) → Success
2. Book SAME offer again → 
   Response: "Already booked, here's your existing booking"
   No duplicate created! ✅
```

### **Scenario 3: Timeout**
```
1. Book offer → Takes 35 seconds
2. API responds: "Timeout - check your bookings"
3. User checks /api/bookings
4. Booking might be there (created on Duffel)
5. Try to book again → Duplicate detection
   "Already booked" ✅
```

---

## ✅ **Best Practices:**

### **1. Always Search Fresh:**
```bash
# Before EACH booking
curl 'http://localhost:5001/api/flights/search?...'

# Get fresh offer (less than 20 minutes old)
# Book immediately!
```

### **2. Use Idempotency Key (Optional):**
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5001/api/flights/create-order' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: unique-key-123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  ...

# If request fails, retry with SAME key
# System returns cached response
# No duplicate bookings!
```

### **3. Handle Timeouts:**
```javascript
// Frontend code
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/flights/create-order', {
    method: 'POST',
    timeout: 35000, // 35 seconds
    ...
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.timeout) {
    // Show: "Booking in progress. Check your bookings in 1 minute."
    setTimeout(() => {
      checkMyBookings(); // Refresh bookings list
    }, 60000);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Timeout or network error
  alert('Please check your bookings - order may have been created');
}
```

## 🎯 **Updated Error Messages:**

### **Offer Already Booked:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Field 'selected_offers' has offers that were already booked",
  "action": "Please search again for a new offer",
  "tip": "Duffel offers are single-use and expire after 20 minutes"
}
```

**Solution:** Search again!

### **Timeout:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Booking request timed out. Order may have been created.",
  "timeout": true,
  "action": "Check /api/flights/my-orders in 1-2 minutes"
}
```

**Solution:** Wait 1 minute, check your bookings

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **Test Duplicate Prevention:**
```bash
# 1. Book a flight
./test-duffel-booking.sh

# 2. Try to book SAME offer again
# → Will say "already booked"
# → Returns existing booking
# → No duplicate! ✅
```

## 💡 **Fixes Implemented:**

1. ✅ **Duplicate Detection** - Checks if offer already booked
2. ✅ **Timeout Handling** - 30-second limit with proper message
3. ✅ **Idempotency Support** - Use `Idempotency-Key` header
