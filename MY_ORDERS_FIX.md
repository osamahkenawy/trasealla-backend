# 🔧 My Orders API Fix

## 🐛 **The Problem**

When calling `/api/flights/my-orders`, you got this error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error fetching flight orders"
}
```

### Root Cause:
```sql
Unknown column 'booking.status' in 'field list'
```

---

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong**

The controller was trying to fetch `booking.status`, but the Booking model has `bookingStatus` (not `status`):

### ❌ Before (Broken):
```javascript
include: [{
  model: Booking,
  as: 'booking',
  attributes: ['id', 'bookingNumber', 'status']  // ❌ Wrong column name
}]
```

### ✅ After (Fixed):
```javascript
include: [{
  model: Booking,
  as: 'booking',
  attributes: ['id', 'bookingNumber', 'bookingStatus', 'paymentStatus']  // ✅ Correct
}]
```

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### Fixed in: `controllers/comprehensiveFlightController.js`

**Two functions updated:**

1. **getMyFlightOrders** (Line 647-659)
   - Changed `status` → `bookingStatus`
   - Added `paymentStatus` field

2. **getAllFlightOrders** (Line 721-738)
   - Changed `status` → `bookingStatus`  
   - Added `paymentStatus` field

---

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### Before Fix:
```bash
GET /api/flights/my-orders
→ ❌ Error: Unknown column 'booking.status'
```

### After Fix:
```bash
GET /api/flights/my-orders
→ ✅ Success: Returns 5 flight orders with booking details
```

**Diagnostic Test Output:**
```
✅ Found 5 orders with booking association

📄 Sample order:
Order ID: 8
Order Number: ORD-FLT-1760037669554
PNR: RI5NQ3
Booking: Associated
```

## 📊 **Booking Model Fields**

For reference, the Booking model has these status-related fields:

| Field | Type | Values |
|-------|------|--------|
| `bookingStatus` | ENUM | pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed |
| `paymentStatus` | ENUM | pending, paid, partially_paid, refunded, failed |

**NOT** just `status`!
